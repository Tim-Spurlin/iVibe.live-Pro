# Issue Templates

This folder contains GitHub issue templates that guide contributors to provide the information we need.

- **bug_report.md** – prompts for context, steps to reproduce, and expected versus actual results so bugs can be investigated efficiently.
- **feature_request.md** – asks for the problem to be solved and proposed solutions, helping the team evaluate new ideas.
- **security_vulnerability.md** – collects details about potential security issues. Please also report security concerns directly to [security@ivibe.live](mailto:security@ivibe.live).

These templates ensure submissions follow a consistent format, allowing issues to move from user reports to project boards without friction.
