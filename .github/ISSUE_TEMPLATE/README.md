# Issue Templates

This directory contains templates that guide users in reporting bugs, requesting new features, and disclosing security vulnerabilities.

- **bug_report.md** – prompts users to outline the problem, helping the team reproduce and fix bugs efficiently.
- **feature_request.md** – asks for details about desired functionality and motivations, enabling thoughtful feature planning.
- **security_vulnerability.md** – provides a structured way to describe potential security issues. For sensitive matters, also report them directly to [security@ivibe.live](mailto:security@ivibe.live).

Using these templates ensures that issues include the information needed to triage tasks and track progress on project boards.
