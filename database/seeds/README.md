# Database Seed Scripts

This folder houses SQL files used to populate the database with synthetic test data. The seeds support automated tests and local development only; never run them against production systems.

## Contents

| File | Criticality |
| --- | --- |
| demo_users.sql | 6 |
| test_events.sql | 6 |

Both scripts are placeholders and should be updated as the schema evolves.
