- Criticality: 10/10
- Purpose: Capture terminal commands and error intelligence for ActivityWatch
- Shell hook installation: `shell/*.rs` inject hooks into Bash, Zsh, Fish, and PowerShell profiles
- Command interception: DEBUG/ERR traps record each command, working directory, and exit status before execution
- Stderr capture & classification: watcher streams stderr, tagging output as error, warning, or info
- Error fix detection: pattern matching spots reruns that resolve previous failures
- Event transmission: structured events (`source: terminal`, command, stderr, classification, fix_detected) sent to the Event Gateway
