# Summarizer Job

Daily task that builds activity digests for each user.

## Summarization process
- Runs at 04:00 UTC via a cron-like scheduler.
- Collects the previous day's events and builds a prompt.
- Uses the selected model to produce a markdown summary.
- Stores the result in the `summaries` table for later search and display.

## Tier-based model selection
- **Free & Essential:** summaries generated with a local model.
- **Pro and above:** summaries generated by GPT-4o through Helicone.

## Cost management
Using local models for lower tiers keeps costs near zero, while Helicone logs remote usage for paying tiers so token spend can be monitored and attributed accurately.
