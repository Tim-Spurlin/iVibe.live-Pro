      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Harmony Score Calculation
```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "harmony_score": 0.847,
  "breakdown": {
    "unity_factor": 0.82,
    "peace_contribution": 0.91,

```

## üßÆ Mathematical Foundation

The service employs sophisticated algorithms including:

### Universal Peace Formula
```
H = Œ£(i=1 to n) [œÜ^i √ó (U_i √ó P_i √ó D_i √ó C_i √ó T_i)] √ó Œ©(location) √ó Œ®(time)
```

Where:
- œÜ (phi) = Golden Ratio (1.618...)
- U_i = Unity factor for element i
- P_i = Peace contribution factor
- D_i = Diversity promotion factor
- C_i = Community building factor  
- T_i = Trust enhancement factor
- Œ©(location) = Geographic harmony amplifier
- Œ®(time) = Temporal harmony modifier

### Workforce Alignment Matrix
Real-time analysis using:
- Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation
- Exponential decay functions for location weighting
- Predictive models for demand level classification
- Machine learning algorithms for engagement optimization

## üåç Global Impact

This service is designed to promote:
- **Global Peace**: Through strategic recognition timing and content
- **Economic Harmony**: By aligning recognition with workforce needs
- **Cultural Unity**: Through cross-cultural recognition and diversity celebration
- **Community Building**: By highlighting local achievements and reducing isolation
- **Career Development**: By promoting needed skills and professions

## üîß Configuration

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `RUST_LOG`: Log level (info, debug, warn, error)
- `BIND_ADDRESS`: Service bind address (default: 127.0.0.1:8086)

### Database Schema
The service requires the recognition database schema from `database/schemas/recognition.sql` which includes:
- Daily recognitions tracking
- Workforce statistics cache
- Employment data with geographic coordinates
- Job market analysis tables
- Historical engagement data for machine learning

## üöÄ Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Database Setup**
